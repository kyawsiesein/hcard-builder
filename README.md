## Running the app

To run the app, please run this command `yarn install && yarn start` in terminal.

## Requirements

-   ✅ As the form is filled out, the preview should be automatically updated
-   ✅ The preview should implement the hCard format
-   ✅ The submit button does not need to function (ie; no backend is required for
    this task)
-   ✅ When the user selects an image, a thumbnail should be shown in the preview
    (no backend is required for this task)
-   ✅ The app should be responsive for different screen widths
-   ✅ The app should work in the latest version of the Chrome browser
-   ✅ Use React

## Improvements which can be made

-   ✅ Adding the validation to the form if required.
-   ✅ For the user experience, we could make the form sections such as (personal details and address) as collapisble sections.
-   ✅ The submit button should show loading / set disable after submitting if the form is not valid based on validation.
-   ✅ When the user selects an image, a thumbnail should be shown in the preview. The button should show loading / set disable after submitting

## 😎 My assumptions

-   Multiple fonts aren't good for the app. In this case, both serif and sans-serif font.
-   Colors are too varied. But I keep colors as minimum.
-   I didn't use formiks and other libraries for forms as I have decided not to do the validation for this app.

## ⏰ Time required for this project (Total duration: around 4 hours)

-   functionality wise of this app, it didn't take more than 2 hours including JSX and structuring.
-   CSS took more than the functionalities.

## 📦 Packages

-   react-grid-system
-   node-sass
-   react-icons (for the placeholder image since i don't find the images from online looks nice)
